      "Smart contract platforms are usually blockchains that host smart contracts or decentralized applications. Users can interact with different smart contracts on these platforms to perform various actions such as lending and borrowing funds, staking their assets or minting NFTs.\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are programs that are stored on the blockchain and are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. To interact with these smart contracts, transaction fees may need to be paid and the amount and asset required will vary based on the platform’s architecture. Usually, the smart contract platform’s native token is used to pay for transaction fees. Some popular examples of smart contract platforms include Ethereum, Solana and Polygon.",

      "Polygon, formerly known as Matic, was originally meant to be a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum to improve transaction throughput and speed. However, it has since become more popular as a stand-alone blockchain, with its own native projects and decentralized applications. Major DeFi protocols such as Aave and Curve have also found second homes on Polygon. Unlike Ethereum, Polygon operates on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in which network participants can stake the network’s native MATIC tokens to validate transactions and participate in voting and other governance decisions. Polygon also hosts its own bridge that allows users to transfer assets from Ethereum to Polygon and vice versa.",

The Avalanche chain is centered around 3 main blockchains - the P-Chain, X-Chain and C-Chain. The C-Chain is Avalanche’s EVM implementation, which hosts various applications and smart contracts.

However, this may soon change with the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi applications on Solana is Serum, built by the team behind FTX.",
